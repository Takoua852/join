        <p class="help-text">
            <span style="color:rgba(41, 171, 226, 1);">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool
            designed
            and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span
                style="color:rgba(41, 171, 226, 1);">Join</span>
            leverages the principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

            It is important to note that <span style="color:rgba(41, 171, 226, 1);">Join</span> is designed as
            an
            educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
            consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span

                    default
                    board. This board represents your project
                    and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                <p class="help-text">In <span style="color:rgba(41, 171, 226, 1);">Join</span>, you can add
                    contacts
                    to collaborate on
                    your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                    section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
                    contacts
                    can be
                    assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

                    represent individual

                <h2>Moving Cards</h2>
                <p class="help-text">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
                    board
                    by
                    dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Deleting Cards</h2>
                <p class="help-text">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
                    delete
                    it.
                    Deleting a
                    card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
